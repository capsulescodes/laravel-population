# Laravel Population

Simplify database migrations and ensure consistency with your database tables effortlessly. Laravel Population package provides a command-line tool that scans your migrations and detects any disparities between them and your database tables. If differences are found, a wizard is triggered to help you migrate and seed the new tables with converted records.

## Installation

```bash
composer install capsulescodes/laravel-population
```

## Usage




```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
